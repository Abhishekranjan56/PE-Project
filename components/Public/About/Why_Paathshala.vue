        <p class="text-gray-850 pt-2 dark:text-[#ddd]"> Paathshala Education knew long ago what many educational experts know today – online
            learning is an effective way to learn and teach. We employ technological advances that make it easier than ever
            for you to feel connected to your students online</p>

        <p class="text-gray-850 font-semibold pt-6 dark:text-white">The World is Our Community</p>
        <p class="text-gray-850 pt-3 dark:text-[#ddd]"> When you become one of our instructors, you’ll facilitate online discussions that are
            practically guaranteed to be rich in content. Online students have an opportunity to think more about their
            written contributions than in-class comments</p>
        <p class="text-gray-850 pt-3 dark:text-[#ddd]">Plus, the opportunity for a diverse student population is greater because our students
            take courses from nearly anywhere</p>
        <p class="text-gray-850 pt-3 dark:text-[#ddd]">
            Over time, your classes will become like online communities with everyone working toward collective goals
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-850 font-semibold pt-6 dark:text-white">Want to Work From a Cafe ? We are Cool With That</p>
        <p class="text-gray-850 pt-3 dark:text-[#ddd]">One of the greatest advantages of being a Paathshala Instructor is the flexibility
            you’ll experience. You can prepare your coursework anytime, day or night</p>
        <p class="text-gray-850 pt-3 dark:text-[#ddd]">This level of flexibility allows you to focus on a full-time career, family and life
            while you teach. And, you can post your classroom presentations from any place that has an internet
            connection—home, work or the neighborhood coffee shop</p>

        <p class="text-gray-850 font-semibold pt-6 dark:text-white">For a Better World</p>
        <p class="text-gray-850 pt-3 dark:text-[#ddd]">The best reason for becoming a Paathshala Instructor is knowing that you are impacting
            your students’ lives in a positive way</p>
        <p class="text-gray-850 pt-3 dark:text-[#ddd]">When you understand just how big the impact Paathshala Education can make for students
            all around the world, your perspective changes; your world gets a little bit bigger and you’ll be inspired to
            continue to exceed your expectations</p>
