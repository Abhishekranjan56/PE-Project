                            progress
                            at each step. I received feedback pertaining to my areas of improvement and not just some
                            general
                            feedback that is applicable to everyone. That helped me immensely to focus on my weak areas

                            and strengthen them with time Paathshala’s strategy of early completion of syllabus has provided
                            one of the biggest advantages by
                            giving me 2 years of time only for practice, revision and test series enabling me to constantly
                            improve my scores. The Full Syllabus Tests helped me understand the concepts that I had
                            forgotten
                            with time and also the topics and chapters in which I need to practice more. The professors
                            clarified all my NEET doubts from time to time, making my revision and practice process
                            effective
                            and efficient. Paathshala’s Mistakes Analysis’ Report has been an amazing tool in helping me
                            find
                            out topics and chapters, where I needed more practice and revision. I have given 200 to 250 NEET
                            Full Syllabus Tests. Solving these many FSTs greatly improved my time management skills and also
                            my
                            ability to stay calm and confident in an exam environment

                            I would recommend Paathshala’s Educational services to all future aspirants. The personal

                        they are true experts in their subjects. The professors here are the best! The environment and
                        ambiance of the classrooms were far beyond my expectation. Good infrastructure, comfortable benches,
                        quality teaching facilities, you name it! Learning here was fun and the environment maintained by
                        the teachers was the cherry on the cake. Our senior students also gave us the information about the
                        mighty class in our 11 Standard. I was also given the right guidance about the books to be referred
                        to, in addition to the study materials provided. I would rest my case on a final note that, if
                        Paathshala is given the opportunity to compete at the higher level, it would gain all the honors and
